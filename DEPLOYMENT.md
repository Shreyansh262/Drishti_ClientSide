# Vercel Deployment Checklist

## Issues Found and Fixed:

### 1. Environment Variables
- ✅ Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard:
  - `VM_HOST` - Your VM's IP address
  - `VM_USER` - Your VM username
  - `VM_PRIVATE_KEY_CONTENT` - Your SSH private key content

### 2. SSH2 Package Compatibility
- ✅ Updated `next.config.mjs` to handle SSH2 native dependencies
- ✅ Added serverless timeout configuration in `vercel.json`

### 3. Error Handling
- ✅ Improved SSH client with timeout handling
- ✅ Added environment checks for serverless compatibility

## Next Steps:

1. **Set Environment Variables in Vercel:**
   - Go to your Vercel project dashboard
   - Navigate to Settings > Environment Variables
   - Add the variables from `.env.example`

2. **Deploy with these commands:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. **Monitor deployment:**
   - Check Vercel function logs for SSH connection errors
   - Monitor API response times (should be under 30 seconds)

## Potential Issues to Monitor:

1. **SSH Connection Timeouts:**
   - Serverless functions have limited execution time
   - Consider caching strategies for frequently accessed data

2. **Cold Start Performance:**
   - First request might be slower due to SSH connection setup
   - Consider implementing connection pooling or caching

3. **File System Access:**
   - Ensure your VM is accessible from Vercel's servers
   - Check firewall rules and SSH key permissions

## Alternative Solutions if SSH2 Doesn't Work:

1. **Use HTTP API instead of SSH:**
   - Create a simple HTTP server on your VM
   - Replace SSH calls with HTTP requests

2. **Use Vercel's Edge Functions:**
   - For better performance and reliability
   - Consider moving time-sensitive operations to Edge

3. **Database Integration:**
   - Store sensor data in a database
   - Reduce real-time SSH dependency
